# no-more-heavy-pandas

## Purpose
This is a personal weight tracking app that I've created to help me achieve my fitness goals. I wanted to have the ability to weigh in every day and haven't been satisfied with the out of the box solutions, so I built something custom using Python and Pandas to display in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Methodology
The approach and calculations are largely based off of information synthesized by Jeff Nippard in his video [How To Build Muscle And Lose Fat At The Same Time: Step By Step Explained (Body Recomposition)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4K0s792wAU) and his [paid companion guide](https://jeffnippard.com/products/the-ultimate-guide-to-body-recomposition).
I'm weighing myself everyday on an [Omron Body Composition Monitor with Scale](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0020MMCDE?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder-t1_ypp_rep_k0_1_5&amp=&crid=2M3CHDYW0MN7A&sprefix=scale&th=1), which gives me readings for weight, Body Fat %, and BMR. I'm tracking my calories and macros through MyFitnessPal (for now) and weighing meals (where possible) on a kitchen scale. Active calorie expenditure is being through my Apple Watch Series 5's "Active Calories" reading. All key metrics are shown on top of a 7-day moving average to smooth out statistical noise and measurement tolerances.

## Goals
- I want to get to my lifelong goal of being at 8% body fat
- I want to be able to track my progress daily (while smoothing out statistical noise)
- I want to keep up my Python and Pandas skills
